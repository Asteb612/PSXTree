# PSXTree
PostregreSQL and Xml relational storage

## Files:
- PSXTree:
    - database.py
    - layer.py

## Examples:
Each example are composed by one file and the inputs data.

The file  ends with the extension \*.psxt and are been used to describe all relationship between layers, files, databases.
Inputs files supported for now are :
  - csv: Table format
  - sql: PostgreSQL structure
  - files generated by pg_dump function
  - xml: File format allow tree data storage
  - kml: File format derived to xml with spatial data

## Workflow

https://trello.com/b/q0ZPESV2

## Goals:
#### Data propagation
v0 -> Data edition from execute are propagated to xml storage
v0 -> Data edition from etree elements are propagated to PostgreSQL storage
#### Double storage
v0.5-> On the importation of xml all data are duplicated in PostgreSQL base
v0.5 -> With the list of all table links duplicated PostgreSQL data to xml storage.
#### Linear and hierarchical navigation
v1 -> Etree object allow execute request from current element on to parent or child.
v1 -> Each request line can converted to Etree object
v2 -> Integrate topological network
#### Optimizations
v2 -> xpath result request can be cashed
v2 -> load/unload xml by part dynamically
v2-> allow multi-threaded function to results
